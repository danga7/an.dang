Hello! I'm An Dang, this is my website project to rebuild my personal portfolio site. (yay!) This is my first time building a site from scratch and I'm excited to get the work done! (or to be continued on and off)

Currently doing a MA in New Media, Aalto University and working part time as a Data Specialist.

My expertises include: UI design, usability testing, data visualization and things in-between.

When not on my laptop, I'll be either in a badminton court or just trolling around towns.
